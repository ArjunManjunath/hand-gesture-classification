# Hand Gesture Recognition.

If you are looking for a quick hand gesture recognition model, you are at the right place.

In the repository I have created two models, a classic machine learning model and a neural network model. which would help you to get started with recognition of hand gestures within no time.

| id |      model      | average accuracy | file |
|----------|:-------------:|:---:|:-------:|
| 1 |  K Nearest Neighbour | 95.1%  | [KnnModel.py](https://github.com/gitmax681/hand-gesture-recognition/blob/master/KnnModel.py)
| 2 |  Neural Network Model  | 97.8%|   [neuralModel.py](https://github.com/gitmax681/hand-gesture-recognition/blob/master/KnnModel.py)

## Test Recognition

- First of all I recommend using a virtual env
- Install all requirements



```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How it works.

## Train With Your data.
